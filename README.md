# datareachable_weather

A simple web app demonstrating weather info for different cities.

## Technical Stack:
Front-end: React.js
Back-end: Express node js
DataBase: Atlas Mongo Cloud (Ongoing)

## Usage:
Run 
```bash
./run.sh
```
to start both the backend server and front end react framework. Backend nodejs server is on http://localhost:8000/ . Front-end page is at http://localhost:3000/

## Bonus Task:
1. Adaptive to different screensize: using Grid from @material-ui library to automated fit in differnet window size. Could have an event listener on window to achieve immediate feedback.
2. Deployment: (Ongoing)
3. Database: (Ongoing)
